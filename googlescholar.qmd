[Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/) is a freely accessible search engine for scholarly literature. It includes journal articles, theses, books, preprints, and more. While not comprehensive, it’s a great starting point for identifying foundational works and following citation trails.
## Using Google Scholar for a Literature Review

### 1. Start with Known Articles  
Begin with a reading you already know is important in your field. Here you can see the partial results of a search for Garret Hardin's "The Tragedy of the Commons" first published in Science in 1968.

 The phrase "tragedy of the commons" has become well used since the publication of this paper and we can see that there are a large number of versions available, so "1968" was added to the title search to narrow it down. 
 
 Remember to use quotation marks to search for exact terms and try using adding the author name or keywords, if you're having trouble finding the article you're looking for.

### 2. Use “Cited by” to Follow the Conversation  
The **“Cited by”** link shows newer articles that referenced the original. Click it to trace how the work influenced later research.

You can use the **“search within citing articles”** option to limit your search to just those articles that cited your original search article.

### 3. Use “Related articles” to Expand Laterally  
Find papers with similar topics or methods, even if they don’t cite the same sources. This helps identify tangential or emerging areas.

### 4. Link to AU Library to Get Full Text  
To set up Google Scholar for accessing AU Library materials, start at the main Google Scholar page and click on the 3 bar menu in the upper left corner. From that menu, select **Settings** then **Library Links** and use the search box to look up _American University_. Check the box for **American University – Full Text at American U**. Then search again for Open WorldCat and check the box for **Open WorldCat – Library Search**, then click **Save**. You’re now ready to use Google Scholar to find and access AU Library resources.

- Adds a **“Full Text @ American U”** to the Google Scholar search results for items available through AU.
- This helps you avoid paywalls and broken links by connecting you to AU Library's holdings.

## Tip for AI-Powered Discovery  
Once you’ve identified a few key papers in Google Scholar, you can use tools like **Semantic Scholar** or **Research Rabbit** to build a visual or AI-enhanced map of related literature.
